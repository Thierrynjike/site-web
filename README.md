# Virtual fitting Room

Nowadays, online shopping is growing up and more people prefer to buy some stuff online including clothes
That's why we thougth about this project

We have created some avatars for some types of body
at the home page index.html, When the user click on the Try It Now button, there appears a javascript modal where user can insert some informations like sex, Height and Weight
for weight we display a range of weights depending on the height value entered to avoid some errors like height = 180cm and weight = 2000kg
once the data are validated the user is redirected to the catalog where he can choose a cloth to enter in the fitting room

our clothes here are self creation with marvelous designer desktop software so the catalog can be adapted.

for 3D rendering we have used the JavaSccript Library Three.js
for data storage, we use cookies and php Get method.
